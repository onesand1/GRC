A function for regulation between gane and genes.

\usage{
regulator(target, data, plot = TRUE, type = "1", scale = TRUE, group = "med", FC = 2, FDR = 0.05)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{target}{
the gene that will be check in expression profile.
}
  \item{data}{
the dataset for gene expression. Consisting of a matrix. Rownames are gene names, colnames are sample ID.
}
  \item{plot}{
a logical value for ploting results.default TRUE, print the figure to window.
}
  \item{type}{
The ragulation type for target. if type=1,  thie model will caculate the downstream genes for target gene; if type=2, it will caculate the  upstream genes for target gene.
}
  \item{scale}{
a logical value indicating whether the expression profile needs to normalized by log2(X+1).default scale=TRUE.
}
  \item{group}{
%%     ~~The group for the target gene expresion profile. default is median and group="med"; it also can set "quar" means  gene expression value less than a quartile and more than three quartile.
}
  \item{FC}{
The fold change for difference between target gene and other genes.
}
  \item{FDR}{
The False discovery rate for results.if type=2,the FDR equal to P-value.
